        <p>Testimonial 1 - John helped my son find a grand piano to help him continue his studies - in the end we
            settled on a second-hand Yamaha with beautiful tone, at a great price. John's team prepared the piano
            brilliantly and even stored it until we were ready for delivery. Delivery went smoothly and on a day which
            suited, and I'm pleased to say my son is very happy! Many thanks and I recommend anyone to take a trip to
            his showroom - we took a 2-hour drive having not been able to find what we were looking for nearer. Thanks
            again</p>

        <p>Testimonial 2 – I am over the moon with my new piano !!! I purchased the SK-3 kawai, it sounds and looks
            amazing! If you are looking for a lovely lifetime piano with fantastic professional customer service, John
            Marley Pianos is the one! The experience from the moment I walked into the show room till the moment that
            the piano got delivered to my house was amazing I had my piano in my living room less than a week. Very
            reliable, professional &#38; friendly service. Highly recommended to anyone looking for good quality pianos
